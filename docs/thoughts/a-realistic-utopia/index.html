<p>Everyone knows 1984 as the quintessential dystopian novel, its popularity partly driven by our natural distrust of government. Although we live in an age of mass data collection, algorithmic manipulation, and polarization, Orwell’s vision depended on a centralized autocratic government that had absolute control over truth, language, and every aspect of life, with no accountability or regard for civil rights. Today’s world is fragmented - power is distributed across governments, companies, and certain influential people. Objective truth may be elusive, but the sheer chaos and plurality of voices make Orwell’s rigid, monolithic regime less viable. The lesser-known counterpart, Brave New World by Aldous Huxley, is a utopian dystopian novel that paints a far more believable future that, through scientific and technological innovation, has elements that are not out of the realm of what could truly exist. Its world, engineered for comfort, feels eerily aligned with where we’re headed today compared to Orwell’s authoritarian nightmare. In contrast, many modern science fiction narratives lean into extremes, whether it’s the cure for immortality or that one Netflix movie where everyone beautiful is at the party and everyone else is in prison. Realistic changes in society that we see glimpses of today might even lead next generations closer to a utopia.</p>
<h2 id="soma-the-happiness-drug">Soma: the Happiness Drug</h2>
<p>One of the most iconic ideas in Brave New World is Soma, a perfectly engineered drug that offers instant, side-effect-free emotional relief. My mom worked on a similar idea during her PhD in chemistry in the 1980s, a drug similar to cocaine but without the negative side effects. Cocaine, while being overall harmful to society, does provide real utility to people that are homeless or generally unhappy with their lives. Imagine being trapped in misery every waking hour, and then someone offers you a pill that promises, for just an hour, you are content and escape from reality. That is until you look at the price tag, realize that it wrecks your brain’s reward system, and soon your life revolves around chasing that fleeting escape. Soma remains out of reach given the current state of medical knowledge including neurology, but the effects on society would be profound.</p>
<h2 id="extreme-value-creation-scales-wealth">Extreme Value Creation Scales Wealth</h2>
<p>Maybe not enough for everyone to live their wildest fantasies, but enough to not have to work again and still live comfortably. In tech, it’s often said that AGI and robotics will unlock so much value that governments could afford to provide universal basic income: a salary for simply existing. But even without AGI, demographic trends are already steering us toward a world where most people may become financially independent by default. Birth control, rising costs of living, and relentless economic pressure have pushed many to opt out of parenthood altogether. In places like Japan and South Korea, the only people still having children in significant numbers tend to come from the upper class.</p>
<h2 id="the-case-for-tech-and-irl-social-networking">The Case for Tech and IRL Social Networking</h2>
<p>It’s no secret that dating apps feel dystopian, but are a necessary evil. But imagine a protocol that makes it easy to network IRL, puts you in spaces where you feel naturally compatible with everyone around you, it just takes a bit of work on your end to strike up a conversation with them to realize it.</p>
<p>But people are complicated and impossible to match reliably through photos and self-reported characteristics. We haven’t fully decoded natural chemistry, but earlier platforms like Omegle and Yik Yak, flawed as they were, hinted at a different kind of potential: low-stakes anonymity, unfiltered interaction, and ambient social presence that today’s swipe-based systems fail at.</p>
<h2 id="everyone-is-truly-beautiful">Everyone is Truly Beautiful</h2>
<p>We don’t need genetic engineering or designer babies to improve the human form-natural selection is already a strong force refining each generation through pressures both social and biological. These pressures don’t just shape physical traits, but also influence how character traits emerge and interact with society. Those who win the genetic lottery often benefit from social privileges but may struggle with empathy or self-awareness. Meanwhile, those closer to the average tend to develop insecurity or lack of confidence. South Korea, for example, has a culture of extreme aesthetic refinement, producing some of the most influential beauty standards. Yet, beneath the surface, rates of depression, loneliness, and bullying remain high.</p>
<p>There’s been incredible strides in making beauty and self-improvement more universal. Fitness, fashion, skincare, and cosmetic procedures have been democratized through both technology and social media. The tools to become presentable by modern standards have never been more available or widely understood. For men, strength training and grooming have gone mainstream. For women, makeup, skincare, and elective procedures are no longer taboo, but normalized forms of self-expression. For everyone, fashion offers a wider range of aesthetics, while drugs and personalized programs are rapidly changing the game for weight loss. Yet, despite all this progress, we’re still far from seeing these advancements reach their full potential in transforming everyone-not just the motivated few.</p>
<p>What remains elusive is a widely accepted tools for improving inner character-the intangibles like confidence, morals, emotional maturity, and authenticity. These qualities are highly dependent on culture, hard to measure, hard to market, and easy to fake. These qualities might also naturally be abundant if other forces come into effect. If future progress, whether technological or cultural, can help people refine not how they look, but how they make others feel, then we might see a generation where everyone is truly beautiful.</p>  </article> </main> </body></html>
