Over the years, my productivity stack has been through many changes. Not deliberately, but out of convenience. My initial desire for organizational structure and feature completeness introduced barriers when it came to daily use. Organizational structure needed updates when new items didn't fit, which added complexity to the structure and effort to remember where things belonged. Complex features I thought I needed went untouched. Iâ€™ve slowly narrowed it down to what feels natural: mobile-native, search bars for reads, tags and headers for writes, mostly apps by Google that integrate well with each other.

- Keep: notes and thoughts
- Tasks: lists and tasks
- Drive: files, backups, and documents
- Google Photos: photos and videos
